**Design of a Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle(UAV) for HV Transmission Line Inspections**

Inspection of a HV transmission line is expensive and time consuming. In this project, you will investigate the possibility of using an UAV to fly over transmission lines. The main idea of the project is to use the electromagnetic field distribution around the HV cables to position and navigate the UAV autonomously.

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
