In this project, you will investigate the possibility of using an UAV to fly over transmission lines. The main idea of the project is to use the electromagnetic field distribution around the HV cables to position and navigate the UAV autonomously.\r\n\r\nThe project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).\r\n\r\n**Project Members:**\r\n\r\n*  Doğa Ceylan\r\n*  Uğur Güdelek\r\n  \r\n\r\n![Quadracopter Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odtu/HV-UAV/master/Images/quadracopter.JPG)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
